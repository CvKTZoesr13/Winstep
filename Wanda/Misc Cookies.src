		     JACK AND THE BEANSTACK
			  by Mark Isaak

	Long ago, in a finite state far away, there lived a JOVIAL
character named Jack.  Jack and his relations were poor.  Often their
hash table was bare.  One day Jack's parent said to him, "Our matrices
are sparse.  You must go to the market to exchange our RAM for some
BASICs."  She compiled a linked list of items to retrieve and passed it
to him.
	So Jack set out.  But as he was walking along a Hamilton path,
he met the traveling salesman.
	"Whither dost thy flow chart take thou?" prompted the salesman
in high-level language.
	"I'm going to the market to exchange this RAM for some chips
and Apples," commented Jack.
	"I have a much better algorithm.  You needn't join a queue
there; I will swap your RAM for these magic kernels now."
	Jack made the trade, then backtracked to his house.  But when
he told his busy-waiting parent of the deal, she became so angry she
started thrashing.
	"Don't you even have any artificial intelligence?  All these
kernels together hardly make up one byte," and she popped them out the
window...

In the beginning there was data.  The data was without form and null,
and darkness was upon the face of the console; and the Spirit of IBM
was moving over the face of the market.  And DEC said, "Let there be
registers"; and there were registers.  And DEC saw that they carried;
and DEC separated the data from the instructions.  DEC called the data
Stack, and the instructions they called Code.  And there was evening
and there was morning, one interrupt...

		William Safire's Rules for Writers:

Remember to never split an infinitive.	The passive voice should never
be used.  Do not put statements in the negative form.  Verbs have to
agree with their subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words
out.  If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal
of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.	A writer must
not shift your point of view.  And don't start a sentence with a
conjunction.  (Remember, too, a preposition is a terrible word to end a
sentence with.)  Don't overuse exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as
close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more
words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully, dangling participles
must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a
linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should
be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their
writing.  Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows
the verb.  Last but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek
viable alternatives.

    There are some goyisha names that just about guarantee that someone isn't
Jewish.  For example, you'll never meet a Jew named Johnson or Wright or Jones
or Sinclair or Ricks or Stevenson or Reid or Larsen or Jenks.  But some
goyisha names just about guarantee that every other person you meet with that
name will be Jewish.  Why is this?
    Who knows?	Learned rabbis have pondered this question for centuries and
have failed to come up with an answer, and you think _y_o_u can find one?  Get

    An old Jewish man reads about Einstein's theory of relativity in the

Gay shlafen:  Yiddish for "go to sleep".

    Now doesn't "gay shlafen" have a softer, more soothing sound than the
harsh, staccato "go to sleep"?  Listen to the difference:
    "Go to sleep, you little wretch!" ... "Gay shlafen, darling." Obvious,
isn't it?
    Clearly the best thing you can do for you children is to start speaking
Yiddish right now and never speak another word of English as long as you
live.  This will, of course, entail teaching Yiddish to all your friends,
business associates, the people at the supermarket, and so on, but that's
just the point.  It has to start with committed individuals and then grow....
    Some minor adjustments will have to be made, of course: those signs
written in what look like Yiddish letters won't be funny when everything is
written in Yiddish.  And we'll have to start driving on the left side of the

     You may find it difficult to find a good half-done kosher dill there in

until about his 35th year, when he became a Christian ....  To him is

because it is absurd).	This does not altogether accord with historical
fact, for he merely said:

	"And the Son of God died, which is immediately credible because

	because it is impossible."

Thanks to the acuteness of his mind, he saw through the poverty of

THIS IS PLEDGE WEEK FOR THE FORTUNE PROGRAM

If you like the fortune program, why not support it now with your
contribution of a pithy fortune, clean or obscene?  We cannot continue
without your support.  Less than 14% of all fortune users are
contributors.  That means that 86% of you are getting a free ride.  We
can't go on like this much longer.  Federal cutbacks mean less money
for fortunes, and unless user contributions increase to make up the
difference, the fortune program will have to shut down between midnight
and 8 a.m.  Don't let this happen.  Mail your fortunes right now to
`fortune'.  Just type in your favorite pithy saying.  Do it now before
you forget.  Our target is 300 new fortunes by the end of the week.
Don't miss out.  All fortunes will be acknowledged.  If you contribute
30 fortunes or more, you will receive a free subscription to "The
Fortune Hunter", our monthly program guide.  If you contribute 50 or
more, you will receive a free "Fortune Hunter" coffee mug....
