Cookie files are ASCII text files that have a .SRC file type.  

Each cookie can be any length and each line should be terminated
by CR/LF (just press ENTER in Notepad).  

Cookies are delimited by *a single line* containing %% or % 
followed by CR/L which signals the end of one cookie and the
start of the next.

As an example, the text below contains 3 cookies:
